# Topic 1 - Mock Objects

Starting Monday Jan 11th

## Suggested Reading

Start by reading this paper from the 2004 OOPSLA conference, written by the inventors of the mock objects technique: http://www.jmock.org/oopsla2004.pdf

Now read this article by Martin Fowler: http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html


Think about the following questions:

• Does TDD with Mock Objects lead us to more maintainable designs?
• To what degree does TDD with Mock Objects allow us to test our software better?
• Different mock object libraries have very different styles - some are very strict whereas the others are much more lenient - which do you feel is more powerful?
• What do you consider to be best practices and worst practices when using mock objects?


Next topic will start Jan 25th (two weeks for the first topic to get us started).
