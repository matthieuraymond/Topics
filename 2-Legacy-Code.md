# Topic 2 - Working with Legacy Code

Starting Monday Jan 25th

## Suggested Reading

Start by looking at this famous paper Big Ball of Mud by Foote and Yoder. It is quite long so we suggest looking at the first 13 pages. http://www.laputan.org/pub/foote/mud.pdf

These articles by Michael Feathers give some more detail and background on some specific techniques for working with legacy code.

Think about the following questions:

- What is the main thing that makes working with legacy code a difficult job? 
- To what degree do tests help us to work with legacy code?
- Are the seams/sensing techniques appropriate for all legacy systems?
