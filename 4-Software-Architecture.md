Think about the following questions:

- What do you think is most important to show in describing software architecture of a given system?
- Which do you think is more useful in communication amongst the stakeholders - whiteboard sketches, or more formal UML (etc) models?
- Agile development discourages Big Design Up Front, is this a conflict with software architecture?
