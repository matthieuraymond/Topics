We suggest you don't worry about understanding the formalism - concentrate on how it fits into the development process.

Think about the following questions:

- How can static analysis techniques be most effectively integrated in a continuous delivery development process?
- Where is it more valuable to invest our efforts - upfront tests and analysis, or post release experiments and monitoring?
- How correctly do we need to test/analyse? What are the drawbacks of being too lenient or too strict?
