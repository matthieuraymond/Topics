# Topic 5 - Continuous Delivery

Starting Monday Feb 15th

## Suggested Reading

Start by looking at this paper on The Deployment Production Line by Humble, Read and North. http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/deployment_production_line.pdf

Then have a look at this case study of the effect that LinkedIn saw putting this into practice: http://www.wired.com/2013/04/linkedin-software-revolution/

You could also look at something focusing more on the process side, rather than the tools, for example looking at Kanban http://leankit.com/blog/2014/06/kanban-and-continuous-delivery/


Think about the following questions:

- What are the problems that a build pipeline is trying to solve?
- To what degree can automation help developers deliver projects more reliably?
- What do you think is most difficult in adopting a “devops” culture?
