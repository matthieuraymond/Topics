# Topic 7 - Resilience at Scale

Starting Monday Feb 29th

## Suggested Reading

Start by looking at this paper introducing the concepts of Yield and Harvest by Fox and Brewer http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.3690&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Compare this with some of the approaches taken by Netflix in building large scale systems that are resilient to faults and problems, http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/12/making-netflix-api-more-resilient.html

Think about the following questions:
- Is resilience the concern of operations engineers, software architects, or software developers? 
- Does moving from a monolith to a microservice architecture help with resilience?
- Are resilience and high capacity co-supporting? Or do they fight against one another?
